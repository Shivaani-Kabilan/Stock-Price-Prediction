# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value  of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The  successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. Predicting stock prices is an uncertain task which is modelled using machine  learning to predict the return on stocks. In this project, the future stock prices of a company’s stock prices are predicted using the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network.
